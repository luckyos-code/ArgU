# Short arguments are irrelevant

Hypothesis: Arguments that are too short (wordcount <= threshold) aren't worth keeping and can be removed.

We tested a few thresholds and think 25 is a good number. We evaluated the first 200 Arguments, whose
word count was smaller than or equals to 25:

As we can see, those arguments mainly aren't real arguments. Only about 4 of 200 args could be considered real arguments:
* 3c02a6e-2019-04-18T17:02:32Z-00002-000
* 7586cae6-2019-04-18T11:18:51Z-00001-000
* 9d4b91c-2019-04-18T16:00:03Z-00004-000
* a81c3486-2019-04-18T11:18:51Z-00001-000

So we removed all arguments, whose text was too short.
This way we go from ... to ... arguments.
