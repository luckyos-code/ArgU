# Numbers are an indicator for good arguments

In this hypothesis we check if arguments, that have many numbers or many percent are good arguments.
Therefore we took the first 5 queries, and for each the top 20 arguments respectivly (without sentiment analysis)
sorted by occuring numbers and percent.
